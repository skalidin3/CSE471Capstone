# CSE471Capstone
~ This project is for CSE 486 Capstone.
~ The goal of the project is to design a neural network that can classify between 8 different classes. 
~ 8 Classes include 4 scenarios like Day, Night, Fog, Fog Night and each of these 4 scenarious are run in distracted and non distracted manner.
~ We are interested in 9 features like Velocity, Lane Pos, Acceleration, Braking, etc. 
~ The Results folder contains the data collected by the simulator on the participants. 
~ Tutorial folder contains some simple neural network examples for everyone to get accustomed to.
